# Grocery Management using LSTM Model

This project implements a Grocery Management System utilizing an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for predictive inventory management. The system is designed to generate synthetic grocery inventory data, train an LSTM model on this data, and then test the trained model for inventory prediction.

## Files Overview

1. **dataset_generation.py**: This script generates synthetic grocery inventory data. It simulates inventory fluctuations, sales patterns influenced by factors such as day of the week and month, and adds noise to the data.

2. **model.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training the LSTM model on the synthetic grocery inventory data generated by `dataset_generation.py`. It utilizes TensorFlow or a similar deep learning framework for model implementation.

3. **test.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook is used for testing the trained LSTM model. It evaluates the model's performance in predicting inventory levels based on historical data.

## Dataset Generation

The `dataset_generation.py` script utilizes NumPy and Pandas libraries to generate synthetic grocery inventory data. It simulates inventory levels and sales patterns over a specified time period, considering factors such as day of the week and month.

## Model Training

The `model.ipynb` notebook trains an LSTM model on the synthetic grocery inventory data. The model is designed to predict future inventory levels based on historical data. It leverages deep learning techniques for sequence prediction.

## Model Testing

The `test.ipynb` notebook evaluates the trained LSTM model's performance in predicting inventory levels. It assesses the accuracy of the model's predictions against actual inventory data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow (or any other deep learning framework)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/grocery-management-system.git
   ```

2. Generate synthetic grocery inventory data by running `dataset_generation.py`.

3. Train the LSTM model on the generated data using `model.ipynb`.

4. Test the trained model using `test.ipynb`.
